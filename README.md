- ‚ú® [Why Rex State?](#why-rex-state)

## Motivation

Rex State was initially built as a state management library. But after using it in many projects, its main purpose became creating hooks where the data returned by the hook can be shared across multiple react components.

## Requirements

Rex State is built purely on React Hooks hence it requires React > 16.8 to work.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add rex-state

# or

npm i rex-state
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { createRexStore } from 'rex-state';

// A simple hook to toggle theme modes between 'light' & 'dark'
const useThemeHook = (initialTheme = 'light') => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(initialTheme);

  const toggleTheme = () => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');

  return [theme, toggleTheme];
};

// using `createRexStore` to create a Provider & a Hook with shared state
const { useStore: useTheme, RexProvider: ThemeProvider } = createRexStore(
  useThemeHook
);

// Use the `ThemeProvider` at the top level of your React component tree
const App = () => {
  // `initialTheme` value can be supplied using the value prop of `ThemeProvider`
  return (
    <ThemeProvider value="dark">
      {/* Rest of your application */}
      <ToggleButton />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};

// All components can now access the `useTheme` hook
const ToggleButton = () => {
  const [theme, toggleTheme] = useTheme();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Is Dark Mode?</Text>
      <Switch value={theme === 'dark'} onValueChange={toggleTheme} />
    </View>
  );
};

// Calling `toggleTheme` in above component will cause updates
// in all the components in the Application tree using the context API
const ThemeText = () => {
  const [theme] = useTheme();

  return (
    <>
      <Text>Theme Mode: </Text>
      <Text>{theme}</Text>
    </>
  );
};
```

## Why Rex State?

- It's Tiny!
- Simple & un-opinionated
- Makes hooks much more powerful

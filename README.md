## Requirements

Rex State is built purely on React Hooks hence it requires React > 16.8 to work.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add rex-state

# or

npm i rex-state
```

## Usage

Consider the following hook which lets you toggle theme between light & dark modes

```jsx
const useThemeMode = (initialTheme = 'light') => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(initialTheme);

  const toggleTheme = () => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');

  return [theme, toggleTheme];
};
```

You can use the `createRexStore` module from rex state to create a provider & a store hook to access the result of your `useThemeMode`

```jsx
import { createRexStore } from 'rex-state';

const { useStore: useTheme, RexProvider: ThemeProvider } = createRexStore(
  useThemeMode
);
```

The `useStore` hook & `RexProvider` are renamed to `useTheme` & `ThemeProvider` for use in the application.

Now you can wrap your entire Application inside the `ThemeProvider` to ensure the context is setup properly for the `useTheme` hook.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider value="dark">
      {/* Rest of your application */}
      <ToggleButton />
      <ThemeText />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

> Note: The value of the argument of `useThemeMode` function - `initialTheme` is supplied to the `ThemeProvider` using the `value` prop. The `value` prop only supports a single argument. Hence if your hook requires multiple arguments, you can pass them as a single object

Once you add the `ThemeProvider` to the top of your application's tree, the child components can now use the `useTheme` hook to access the result of your `useThemeMode` hook. This time, when you call `toggleTheme` in any of the child components, it will cause your entire application tree to re-render & all the components that use the `useTheme` hook will have the updated value!

The following is a toggle button that toggles the theme when users click on it.

```jsx
const ToggleButton = () => {
  const [theme, toggleTheme] = useTheme();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Is Dark Mode?</Text>
      <Switch value={theme === 'dark'} onValueChange={toggleTheme} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

The next component is a text block that simply displays the theme's mode

```jsx
const ThemeText = () => {
  const [theme] = useTheme();

  return (
    <>
      <Text>Theme Mode: </Text>
      <Text>{theme}</Text>
    </>
  );
};
```

Invoking the `toggleTheme` function from the `<ToggleButton/>` component updates the `<ThemeText/>` component. This means your hook is now a shared state between the two components!

Also, check out the [counter example](https://codesandbox.io/s/rex-counter-2m4zy?file=/src/App.js) from codesandbox

Rex State is good for some use cases and not suitable for some use cases since it uses the [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#api) API which is considered inefficient as a change causes the entire React child tree to re-render. Read the [performance](https://rex-state.netlify.app/?path=/story/intro-performance--page) section to see how to use Rex State effectively.

## Why Rex State?

Rex State is a handy utility to make your hooks more powerful. It is simple, un-opinionated & is very tiny!

## `createRexStore`

```tsx
createRexStore: <T, V>(useRexState: (value?: V | undefined) => T) => {
    RexProvider: React.FC<{
        children: ReactNode;
        value?: V | undefined;
    }>;
    useStore: {
        <K>(selector: (val: T) => K): K;
        (selector?: ((val: T) => T) | undefined): T;
    };
}
```

`createRexStore` accepts your hook as the argument and returns an object with two properties ï¹£

- `RexProvider` which is a Provider component that will let you pass your hook down the React component tree to all the components by storing it in React context.
- `useStore` hook will fetch your hook from the React context into your current component. This is built on top of the [`use-context-selector`](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector#createcontext) hook.

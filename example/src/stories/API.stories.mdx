## `createRexStore`

```tsx
createRexStore: <T, V>(useRexState: (value?: V) => T) => ({
  RexProvider: (props: { children: ReactNode; value?: V }) => JSX.Element;
  useStore: () => T;
});
```

`createRexStore` accepts your hook as the argument and returns an object with two properties ï¹£

- `RexProvider` which is a "[`Provider`](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider)" component that will let you pass your hook down the React component tree to all the components by storing it in React context.
- `useStore` hook will fetch your hook from the React context into your current component. This is built on top of the react "[`useContext`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext)" hook.

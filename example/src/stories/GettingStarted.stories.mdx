Rex State allows you to convert your hooks into full fledged stores which can then be shared between multiple react components.

## Usage

Consider the following hook which lets you toggle theme between light & dark modes

```jsx
const useTheme = (initialTheme = 'light') => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(initialTheme);

  const toggleTheme = useCallback(
    () =>
      setTheme((currentTheme) => (currentTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')),
    []
  );

  return { theme, toggleTheme };
};
```

You can use the `createRexStore` module from rex state to create a provider & a store hook to access the result of your `useTheme` hook

```jsx
import { createRexStore } from 'rex-state';

const { useStore: useThemeStore, RexProvider: ThemeProvider } = createRexStore(
  useTheme
);
```

The `useStore` hook & `RexProvider` are renamed to `useThemeStore` & `ThemeProvider` for use in the application.

Now you can wrap your entire Application inside the `ThemeProvider` to ensure the context is setup properly for the `useThemeStore` hook.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider value="dark">
      {/* Rest of your application */}
      <ToggleButton />
      <ThemeText />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

> Note: The value of the argument of `useTheme` function - `initialTheme` is supplied to the `ThemeProvider` using the `value` prop. The `value` prop only supports a single argument. Hence if your hook requires multiple arguments for eg: `useFunc(a, b)`, you can pass them as a single object `useFunc({a, b})`

Once you add the `ThemeProvider` to the top of your application's tree, the child components can now use the `useThemeStore` hook to access the result of your `useTheme` hook. This time, when you call `toggleTheme` in any of the child components, it will cause your entire application tree to be aware of the state change & all the components that use the `useThemeStore` hook will have the updated value!

The following is a toggle button that toggles the theme when users click on it.

```jsx
const ToggleButton = () => {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useThemeStore();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Is Dark Mode?</Text>
      <Switch value={theme === 'dark'} onValueChange={toggleTheme} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

The next component is a text block that simply displays the theme's mode

```jsx
export const ThemeText = () => {
  const theme = useThemeStore((store) => store.theme);

  return (
    <>
      <Text>Theme Mode: </Text>
      <Text>{theme}</Text>
    </>
  );
};
```

## In Action

<br />

<DarkModeProvider value="dark">
  <ToggleButton />
  <ThemeText />
</DarkModeProvider>

<br />
<br />
<br />

As you can see, calling the `toggleTheme` function from the `<ToggleButton/>` component updates the `<ThemeText/>` component. This means your hook is now a shared state between the two components!

To make sure the re-rendering of components is performant & efficient Rex State doesn't use the [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#api) API, instead uses the awesome [use-context-selector](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector).

# Performance

Rex State makes the values returned by Hooks shareable using the React Context API. But there are knows performance limitations since changing the value of Context causes the entire Application tree to re-render.

Rex State used to have an [`InjectStore`](https://github.com/daniakash/rex-state/tree/9809c7a7a6f71c1644a7d94a058b5606cf49da11#performance) HOC which implemented the solutions suggested by [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15156#issuecomment-474590693). This HOC is removed in v1.0 as the goal of Rex State is no longer to be a state management tool, but, to be an utility to share hooks across components.

You can directly implement the performance optimizations suggested in the above comment if you need. If you are looking for a powerful state management tool that can efficiently avoid unnecessary re-renders, you can try [recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) or [zustand](https://github.com/react-spring/zustand).
